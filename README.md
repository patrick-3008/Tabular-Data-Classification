# Rice Type Classification using PyTorch

## Overview
This project classifies different types of rice grains using deep learning models implemented in PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of rice images and predicts the rice variety based on visual features.

## Features
- Implemented using **PyTorch** for deep learning.
- Preprocessing pipeline for image augmentation.
- Uses a **fully connected neural network (FNN)** instead of CNN.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Model performance visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of different rice varieties. If you're using a public dataset, provide a link here. Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed and split into **training, validation, and test sets**.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/patrick-3008/Tabular-Data-Classification.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have **PyTorch** installed. Visit [PyTorch official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the compatible version for your system.

## Model Architecture
The model is a **fully connected neural network (FNN)**. You can modify the notebook to experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters.

## Results
You can visualize results using Matplotlib.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by creating **issues** or **pull requests**!
